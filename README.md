## How to Contribute to TechPrimers Open Source Community
Weâ€™d love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.
You can follow steps on forking and raising pull requests from [firstcontributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md)

## Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.

## Documentation
Documentation is the essense of a good Open Source project. Whenever you feel there is a need for documentation, please add necessary documentation. 

## Commit Messages
Add some meaningful commit messages so that it's easy for contributors to make a sense of what constitutes the commits.

## Resolve peacefully
We do not believe that all conflict is necessarily bad; healthy debate and disagreement often yields positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful.

If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to address the behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.

## Copyrights
All code repositories under this Github Organization is primarily covered under [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Meaning - you can distribute, share, copy, merge the software, however you need to add the MIT license along with the code.

### Happy Coding!
