## How to Contribute to TechPrimers Open Source Community
Weâ€™d love to accept your patches and contributions to the open source projects. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.
You can follow steps on forking and raising pull requests from [firstcontributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md)
[Github Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace) has lots of Free and Open Source tools which we can leverage in every repository.

## Continuous Integration
We have [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/TechPrimers) integrated into the TechPrimers account. Leverage the CI wherever necessary and show your TDD skills in writing clean and neat code.

## Code Scans
By default Github scans code for vulnerabilities. However that's not reliable. Hence we leverage `Codacy` to perform scans. Every opensource project needs to enable `Codacy` scan.

## Code Reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.

## Documentation
Documentation is the essense of a good Open Source project. Whenever you feel there is a need for documentation, please add necessary documentation. 

### Style
Every open source repository in TechPrimers should have the badges similar to the one in the top. The template for that can be taken from here

## Commit Messages
Add some meaningful commit messages so that it's easy for contributors to make a sense of what constitutes the commits. If there are new files, use `#1: [add]` and if there are any modifications to existing files, use `#1: [update]`. This creates uniform commit message again an issue. If there are no issues to commit against, don't use the issue number.

## Branch Naming Conventions
- `master` - Final Production branch
- `develop` - Release Candidate branch for testing
- `feature` - `feature-1-<TEXT>` branch for adding features/bug fixes

All code repositories under this Github Organization is primarily covered under [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
