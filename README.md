## How to Contribute to TechPrimers Open Source Community
Weâ€™d love to accept your patches and contributions to the open source projects. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.
You can follow steps on forking and raising pull requests from [firstcontributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md)

## Continuous Integration
We have [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/TechPrimers) integrated into the TechPrimers account. Leverage the CI wherever necessary and show your TDD skills in writing clean and neat code.

## Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.

## Documentation
Documentation is the essense of a good Open Source project. Whenever you feel there is a need for documentation, please add necessary documentation. 

### Style
Every open source repository in TechPrimers should have the badges similar to the one in the top. The template for that can be taken from here
